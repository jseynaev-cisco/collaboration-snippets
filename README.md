Cisco Live 2018 working code snippets

## Disclaimer
These snippets are provided as is.  The focus being on a 'simple and working' example that is easy to 
read and understand, containing the core code for doing the job.  
No focus has been given to production level security or handling every error / exception. Some knowledge of the used 
programming language will be needed to make a robust script 

The snippets are in Python, Perl and Java.  Some hints are given in the README files for used libraries 
or other dependencies. However, we do expect you to be able to install these dependencies yourself 
(as well as identifing if some are missing)

## How to use
The scripts are tested on our systems, we didn't do any extensive cross-platform magic ... if all else fails, 
try it on Ubuntu.  
No commandline arguments are needed, the script should ask for everything it needs
